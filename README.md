# How Long Until Web App

## Description

This web app lets you easily create URLs with a date/time and an optional occasion which will direct to a countdown
timer. It's simple, operates without a backend, and is aesthetically beautiful - perfect for sharing and bookmarking. While there
are similar websites, they seemed to be overly complicated to create, looked visually crowded, or not mobile friendly, so I decided to make my own.
